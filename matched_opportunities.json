    "description": "Open to:Bachelor, Master students from all CIVIS universities (African and European), from all subject areas and disciplinesParticipation mode:onlineCosts:free of chargeApplication deadline:31 March 2025 More information:https://civis.eu/en/learn/civis-courses/global-awareness CIVIS micro-programmes allow students to combine multiple CIVIS courses or modules into one coherent learning pathway which reinforces or complements their main study programme.The Micro-Programme on Global Awareness offers students of all subjects and degrees the possibility to acquire transdisciplinary competencies in the comprehension and analysis of global and cross-border phenomena. Meeting global challenges - such as issues concerning energy, the climate and the environment - is a core aspiration of the CIVIS Alliance. With this in mind, CIVIS member universities the University of Bucharest, the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and the University of Tübingen have launched a joint micro-programme on Global Awareness. It provides in-depth knowledge about globalisation and cross-border processes, as well as opportunities to reflect on global interconnections and interrelationships in everyday life. Covering a broad range of topics and approaches, the courses offered in this program foster the development of inter- and transdisciplinary competencies and problem-solving skills to deal with the social, cultural, economic, legal, political and ecological problems of our time, preventing racism and fostering peace and understanding. In this way, students are equipped to become responsible actors in a globalised world. The micro-programme Global Awareness is a flexible way to complement your studies. It comprises 15 ECTS which should be earned in courses offered by, at least, two universities participating in the programme, in a period of two years after acceptance (or until you graduate, if it happens before the two years are complete). The courses also have a very flexible schedule. They follow the calendar of the university which offers them. It means that there are new courses beginning almost every month! The micro-programme Global Awareness gives you flexibility when it comes to planning your time, choosing your learning strategies, and meeting your needs. The courses are offered mostly online, with some courses in presence. Their formats vary from block seminars, intensive courses as summer schools, to courses that cover the entire lecture period, following the academic calendars of the three participating universities. For this reason, the courses may have different schedules than you are used to at your home university. The courses are offered mostly in English and are attended by students from different universities, which gives you the possibility to internationalize your studies. They are certified according to workload (for example, 3 ECTS = 75-90 h workload) and their assignments are marked with pass/not pass. The graduation requirement of the micro-programme is the achievement of 15 ECTS under these conditions: attended courses were offered by the micro-programme Global Awareness,courses were attended in, at least, two of the three participating universities, with at least two course in two different universities,credit points were earned within a period of two years after acceptance in the micro-programme (or less, if you graduate before the period of two years is complete). You are expected to complete, at least, two courses in the first year after you were accepted in the micro-programme. There is not any additional final examination form. The micro-programme is open to students from all subjects and degrees currently enrolled in a CIVIS University, and is completely free of charge.

    "description": "La Tunisie, bien que confrontée à de nombreux défis économiques et sociaux, s’engage résolument à devenir une économie fondée sur la connaissance grâce à des investissements soutenus dans la recherche et le développement (R&D). LeRapport final sur l’État des lieux de la Gouvernance de la Recherche en Tunisierécemment publié fournitune analyse approfondie de l’état actuel de la gouvernance de la recherche dans le pays, en identifiant à la fois ses réussites et des pistes d’amélioration pour le système. Depuis la révolution de 2010, la Tunisie a connu des transformations notables, mais reste encore confrontée à des défis majeurs tels que le chômage et les inégalités régionales. Malgré ces obstacles, la production scientifique tunisienne a augmenté de 20 % entre 2019 et 2022, plaçant le pays au 12ème rang mondial en termes de publications scientifiques. Cette progression est le fruit d’une politique ambitieuse qui vise à intégrer les résultats de la recherche dans les secteurs économiques clés, tout en favorisant des collaborations internationales. Travail Accompli pour la Production du Rapport Le travail accompli pour la production du Rapport sur l’État des lieux de la Gouvernance de la Recherche en Tunisiea été rigoureux et complet. Il a impliqué plusieurs étapes clés, notamment : Recherche et synthèse des références documentaires pertinentes pour la gouvernance de la recherche en Tunisie.Un travail debenchmarking, c’est-à-dire d’évaluation et de comparaison du système tunisien par rapport aux systèmes des partenaires européens du projet DIRASA (France, Italie).La consultation des universités tunisiennes et des directeurs généraux des structures de gouvernance de la recherche en Tunisie (DGRS, DGVR, CNEARS, ANPR) pour valider les informations et identifier les besoins actuels et futurs de la recherche en Tunisie. Ces efforts ont permis demettre en lumière les défis et les opportunités pour renforcer la qualité et l’efficacité de la recherche en Tunisie, offrant ainsi des pistes de réflexion et d’action pour les acteurs impliqués dans le domaine de la recherche. Les principaux thèmes abordés dans le rapport sont les suivants : Pilotage et organisation de la rechercheDémocratie de la rechercheCohérence de la rechercheEfficacité de la recherche Défis Identifiés dans le Système de Recherche Tunisien : La nécessité de professionnaliser la gestion des projets de recherche, de diversifier les sources de financement et d’améliorer l’efficacité de l’utilisation des ressources.L’importance de renforcer les collaborations entre chercheurs et entre les différentes entités de recherche, pour favoriser l’innovation et la qualité des travaux.La valorisation de la recherche et son impact sur l’innovation et le développement socio-économique du pays. Recommandations pour l’Amélioration de la Recherche en Tunisie : Mettre l’accent sur la gestion et la qualité des structures de recherche, ainsi que sur leur évaluation.Renforcer le cadre éthique et les normes des activités de recherche pour garantir la crédibilité et la reconnaissance.Encourager la recherche appliquée en lien avec les besoins régionaux et socio-économiques.Développer les collaborations entre chercheurs et les partenariats public-privé pour favoriser l’innovation et la création de réseaux de recherche communs. La lecture de ce rapport est essentielle pour comprendre les dynamiques actuelles de la recherche scientifique en Tunisie et les pistes à suivre pour renforcer la compétitivité internationale du pays.Il constitue une ressource précieuse pour les décideurs politiques tunisiens et tous les acteurs impliqués dans le domaine de la recherche.

    "description": "LAST CHANCE! Submitting to the 2025 global \"Public Communication of Science & Technology Conference\" (Aberdeen, UK) Abstract Submission Abstract submission is now open - and the Call for Proposals is below - so get your thinking caps on to come up with the best set of submissions for PCST yet! The PCST (Public Communication of Science and Technology) Network announces the call for proposals for its next conference, to be held in Aberdeen, Scotland, 27 – 29 May 2025. The global PCST Network is a professional networking and career development space for researchers, students, and practitioners who are involved in exploring or doing public communication of science. We invite science and technology communication researchers and practitioners to submit proposals for this conference, in line with the theme and guidelines below. Please submit your proposals via the online submission system no later than 7 September 2024 (17:00 BST). SUBMIT YOUR ABSTRACT HERE PCST 2025 Conference Theme The theme for the 2025 Conference is ‘Science communication for positive change: exploring transitions, traditions, and tensions.’ In our work as science communicators, we are influenced by transitions, traditions, and tensions. In 2025, the PCST Conference will bring us together to discuss how science communication can make a positive impact in our evolving world, particularly in the face of challenges like the climate crisis, global health concerns, and poverty. The conference will focus on three main themes: Transitions: We invite contributions that delve into the dynamics of change and stability in science communication. This includes transitions within organisations (e.g. universities) and groups (e.g. community organisations), power dynamics, advancements in science, technology, environmental sustainability, health and well-being, fairness, and aspects of cultures, citizenship, governance, and identity. Traditions: The theme of traditions encompasses the old, current, and new aspects of science and technology communication. We welcome submissions that explore how different forms of knowledge coexist, complement, or contradict each other. This can include perspectives on people, technologies, histories, and future developments in science and technology communication. Tensions: The tension theme examines how disputes and consensus influence science and technology communication. We encourage submissions that explore various tensions, such as theory versus practice, academics versus professionals, scientists versus citizens, expertise versus lived experience, different forms of knowledge production, communication versus engagement, and various forms of capital. By addressing these themes, we aim to better understand the role of science and technology communication in navigating a changing world and driving positive transformations. About PCST Conferences Biennial PCST conferences provide a meeting place for the global community of practitioners, educators, and researchers in the diverse and growing field of science and technology communication and engagement. These gatherings incorporate elements of academic and professional conferences, including presentations of research, reflections on practice, and practical workshops and demonstrations. The conferences are open to all who have a professional or personal interest in science communication, as practitioners, educators, researchers, or in any combination of these roles. During PCST conferences, science communication researchers and practitioners jointly explore the evolving relationship between science and society, and reflect on the evolving relationship between science communication research and practice. The 2025 conference will be the 18th event of its kind and is hosted by the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, UK.
